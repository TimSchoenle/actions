### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (latest version)

### Creating a New Action
To create a new action, run the interactive CLI:

```bash
bun run create-action
```
This command will guide you through setting up the action structure, `action.yaml`, and initial workflow files.

### Removing an Action
To safely remove an action and its associated configuration:

```bash
bun run remove-action
```
This ensures all related files and configurations are properly cleaned up.
